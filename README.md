# Serve map files for #ohmygrid website

## Information

Country map images are produced by : https://github.com/ben10dynartio/osm-power-grid-map-analysis

The repository works with a docs folder at the root. This folder is not synchronized with the repository (added in .gitignore) : it is not versionned file and this added as a zip file on releases.

Structure of `docs` repository :
```
docs
|-- countrypages
|   |-- Afghanistan.md
|   |-- ...
|   |-- Zimbabwe.md
|-- images
|   |-- maps_countries
|   |   |-- AE
|   |   |   |-- grid-connectivity.png
|   |   |   |-- high-voltage-network.png
|   |   |-- ...
|   |   |-- ZW
|   |       |-- grid-connectivity.png
|   |       |-- high-voltage-network.png
|   |-- maps_countries_legend_grid.jpg
|   |-- maps_countries_legend_progress.jpg
|-- progress.md
```

Each new realease contains a `docs.zip` which is a docs folder that have to be merged the docs folder of the website before mkdocs build.

`country_page_generation.py` script takes data from `openinframap_countries_info_brut.csv`, `powergrid_analysis_countries_info.csv`, `wikidata_countries_info_formatted.csv` files, and builds corresponding `[country].md` files in `countrypages` folder. Finally, it takes `docs` folder and zip it for associating to new release.

* Run `gather_country_stats.py`
* Get all export folder, push them in docs/maps_countries/
* Get `powergrid_analysis_countries_info.csv` and paste it in `scripts/countrypage_generation/`
* Draft new release : Add `docs.zip`as binary file, publish rel
